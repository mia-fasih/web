    <p> Grains are a staple food in households around the world.
    
    They have three parts: the bran (the nutritious outer layer), the germ (the seed’s nutrient-rich embryo) and the
    endosperm (the germ’s food supply, which is high in starchy carbs).
    
    Whole grains are simply grains that have all three parts intact. They’re typically high in iron, magnesium, manganese,
    phosphorus, selenium, B vitamins and dietary fiber </p>

    <h1> Types of grains</h1>
</div>
    <div class="aside">
    <h2>Whole grains.</h2>
</div>
    <p>
    These grains are either present in their whole form or ground into a flour while retaining all parts of
    the seed (bran, germ and endosperm). Compared with other types of grains, whole grains are better sources of fiber and
    other important nutrients, such as B vitamins, iron, folate, selenium, potassium and magnesium. Whole grains are either
    single foods, such as brown rice and popcorn, or ingredients in products, such as buckwheat in pancakes or whole-wheat
    flour in bread.</p>
<div class="aside">
    <h2>Refined grains. </h2>
</div>
    <p>
    Refined grains are milled to have had the germ and bran removed, which gives them a finer texture and
    extends their shelf life. The refining process also removes many nutrients, including fiber. Refined grains include
    white flour, white rice and white bread. Many breads, cereals, crackers, desserts and pastries are made with refined
    grains.</p2>
<div class="aside">
    <h2>Enriched grains. </h2>
</div>
    <p>
    Enriched means that some of the nutrients lost during processing are replaced. Some enriched grains
    have replaced the B vitamins lost during milling. Fortifying means adding in nutrients that don't occur naturally in the
    food. Most refined grains are enriched, and many enriched grains also are fortified with other vitamins and minerals,
    such as folic acid and iron. Whole grains may or may not be fortified. </p>
